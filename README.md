# Robotic Arm: Inverse & Forward Kinematics for Pick & Place

##### In this project, I calculated Kinematics on `Kuka KR210` and performed pick & place with `91.9%` success rate. Below are more details:
1. Analyzed the Forward Kinematics with the `Kuka KR210` and derived DH parameters
2. Performed Kinematic Analysis of the robot and derived equations for 6 individual joint angles
3. Verified the results through `Rviz` window displaying the actual path planned by the simulator
4. Controlled the `Kuka KR210` arm to follow the planned path by using `PID` control algorithm

##### Code reference

The core code is generated inside `IK_server.py` under `\kuka_arm\scripts`.

##### Results reference

There is a report under `\documents` for more details about what I did and the results generated by my method.
